Lorenzo Ashurst and Zane Metz create a way to play Among Us in real life. We dont make any money from this so hopefully that bars us from copyright claims or whatever because this game is full of 'em. Jackson Greer is listed as a contributor but truthfully he didnt do much before he was BOOTED off. If you wanna work on this awesome possum project just lmk.
